# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition

## **Recognising Handwritten Digits on MNIST Dataset using KNN.(train.csv)

Collection from mnist dataset and recognize the number using k nearest neighbour.

step 1:- for the x test picking out k nearest neighbour based on distance using euclidean distance formula.

step 2:-out of k nearest point find majority votes

step3:-Sort all those distance & then we will pick prediction from k points.

We will be given X image 28x28 size, that image will contain a digit. and y will be the digit recognition this will correspond to  x image.
#### Library used :-numpy, pandas,sklearn,matplotlib and seaborn**
